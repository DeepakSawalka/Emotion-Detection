# Emotion-Detection
 
# Poject Objective:-

1.In the past, teachers in the classroom could identify and detect the emotions of the students. Whether they enjoyed the material or the teaching style, alternative methodologies were used as a result. 

2.In the online learning environment, teachers often struggle to comprehend the emotions of the students during lectures.

3.Therefore, we suggest a study that aids teachers in recognizing students' emotions in the classroom by recording each student's face on a camera and detecting their emotions.

4.This project involved developing a research study to categorize facial emotions from static facial photos using deep learning techniques
